The mausoleum, designed by Don Arthur, houses the bodies of Kwame Nkrumah and his wife Fathia Nkrumah. The building is meant to represent an upside down sword, which in Akan culture is a symbol of peace.

Kwame Nkrumah Mausoleum, also know as the Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Park(KNMP) is the last resting place of the first President of Ghana, Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah.

The entrance to the site is from the 28th February High Street just along the coast from Independence Square.
